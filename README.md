## Option Pricing Models

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for implementing and analyzing option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo simulation, and the Binomial tree method. These models are essential for understanding and calculating the fair value of options in financial markets.


### Introduction

Options are financial derivatives that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price before or at a specified date. This project aims to provide a toolkit for option pricing, using well-known models such as the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo simulation, and the Binomial tree method.

### Features

- **Black-Scholes Model:** Analytical pricing for European options.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** A stochastic method for pricing options, especially useful for path-dependent options.
- **Binomial Tree Method:** A discrete-time model for pricing American and European options.
- **Heatmap Visualization:** Display the effects of varying parameters on option prices.
- **Greek Calculations:** Compute the Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Rho) for risk management.
